# Identification-of-Prime-Numbers-Romanian-

An analisys of three algorithms used for testing prime numbers: Solovay-Strassen, Frobenius si Fermat. For the first and the last I have written implementations in Java. This thesis gives a short descriptions of the algorithms, analyses their worst-case time complexities and compares them to one another, with advantages and disadvantages. In this repository you can find the source codes for the Solovay-Strassen algorithm and the Fermat algorithm which are written in Java, and the thesis itself, which is in Romanian.
